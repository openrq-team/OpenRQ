/**
 * A decoder for a source block.
 * <p>
 * A source block decoder is retrieved from a {@link DataDecoder} object, which is associated to some source data.
 * Source data is divided into source blocks and each source block is independently encoded by a RaptorQ encoder (as
 * specified in RFC 6330). Each source block is further divided into source symbols, which together with repair symbols
 * (extra encoded data) form the <em>encoding symbols</em>. The encoding symbols are transmitted inside encoding packets
 * to specific source blocks of the data being decoded.
 * <p>
 * A source block can be decoded independently by an instance of {@code SourceBlockDecoder}, and the block is identified
 * by a source block number, which is carried inside an encoding packet. The method {@link #sourceBlockNumber()}
 * provides the source block number that identifies the source block being decoded. Additionally, the number of source
 * symbols into which the source block is divided is given by the method {@link #numberOfSourceSymbols()}.
 * <p>
 * The method {@link #putEncodingPacket(EncodingPacket)} receives an encoding packet as argument and stores the encoding
 * symbols inside it for future decoding. If at the time the method is called, enough symbols are available for decoding
 * the source block (see "symbol overhead" below), then a decoding operation takes place which either succeeds or not (a
 * decoding failure).
 * <p>
 * Handling decoding failures is a task for the user. Typically, the user requests the sender for any missing source
 * symbols or simply waits for more encoding symbols (source or repair) to be available. The method
 * {@link #missingSourceSymbols()} returns a set with the identifiers of all missing source symbols, and the method
 * {@link #availableRepairSymbols()} returns a set with the identifiers of all available repair symbols so far.
 * <p>
 * <a name="symbol-overhead">
 * <h5>Symbol overhead</h5></a>
 * <p>
 * Imagine a source block being divided into {@code K} source symbols. Let {@code N} be the number of received encoding
 * symbols (source or repair) so far.
 * <p>
 * If all {@code K} source symbols are received then the decoding is immediate. When that is not the case, the decoder
 * will try to fill in the gaps of the missing source symbols with the received repair symbols. Whichever the case, the
 * decoder requires at least {@code N = K} encoding symbols in order to try recovering the source data.
 * <p>
 * However, {@code K} encoding symbols may not be sufficient for a successful decoding when some of those are repair
 * symbols (RaptorQ is a probabilistic code). To increase the probability of successful decoding in this case, a source
 * block decoder may be configured to start the decoding process only when it has received {@code N > K} encoding
 * symbols. The higher {@code N} is, the higher the probability. We call the {@code N - K} symbols the <b>symbol
 * overhead</b>.
 * <p>
 * The method {@link #symbolOverhead()} returns the current symbol overhead value, and the method
 * {@link #setSymbolOverhead(int)} changes that value.
 * <p>
 * Below are example symbol overhead values that allow a successful decoding with a specific probability given a number
 * of encoding symbols <em>(the probability values only apply if some of the encoding symbols are repair symbols)<em>:
 * <blockquote>
 * <table summary="Probability of successful decoding for different values of symbol overhead">
 * <tr>
 *     * <th align="left">Overhead</th>
 * <th align="left">Encoding symbols</th>
 * <th align="left">Probability</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td><code>0</code></td>
 * <td><code>K</code></td>
 * <td>99%</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td><code>1</code></td>
 * <td><code>K + 1</code></td>
 * <td>99.99%</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td><code>2</code></td>
 * <td><code>K + 2</code></td>
 * <td>99.9999% <em>(one in a million chance of failure)</em> </td> </tr> </table> </blockquote>
