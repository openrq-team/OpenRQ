/**
 * This is the main package in the OpenRQ API.
 * <p>
 * The OpenRQ API provides a way to encode and decode data according to the fountain erasure code RaptorQ, as defined in
 * <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6330">RFC 6330</a>.
 * <h2>Where to use this API</h2> OpenRQ is intended as an erasure corrector for unreliable or noisy communication
 * channels. Typically, the following steps are performed:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Data is encoded using encoder objects, resulting in encoded packets;
 * <li>The encoded packets are transmitted to one or more receivers using any communication protocol;
 * <li>Encoded packets are collected by decoder objects at the receivers until a certain number is reached;
 * <li>Data is decoded from the encoding packets, resulting in the original data.
 * </ol>
 * <b>Note:</b> <em>The use of this API is also recommended in situations where retransmissions are costly, such as when
 * broadcasting data to multiple destinations, or when communication links are one-way.</em>
 * <h2>How to use this API</h2> This section provides an overall view of the API, explaining the terms used throughout
 * the documentation and presenting which classes the user is supposed to use.
 * <h3>Terminology</h3>
 * <dl>
 * <dt><b>Source data:</b></dt>
 * <dd>The data object to be encoded/decoded.</dd>
 * <dt><b>Source block:</b></dt>
 * <dd>A contiguous portion of the source data. Each source block is encoded/decoded independently from the others.
 * Source data is partitioned into source blocks in order to allow efficient decoding with limited working memory.</dd>
 * <dt><b>Source symbol:</b></dt>
 * <dd>A contiguous portion of a source block. Source symbols are the smallest unit of source data. Source blocks are
 * partitioned into source symbols in order to provide packets containing small amounts of data.</dd>
 * <dt><b>Repair symbol:</b></dt>
 * <dd>A piece of encoded data with the same size as a source symbol. Repair symbols are generated from an encoder.</dd>
 * <dt><b>Encoding symbol:</b></dt>
 * <dd>A generic term for a source or repair symbol.</dd>
 * <dt><b>Encoding packet:</b></dt>
 * <dd>A packet of data containing one or more encoding symbols.</dd>
 * <dt><b>Encoder:</b></dt>
 * <dd>An object that receives source data, encodes it, and produces encoding packets for transmission.</dd>
 * <dt><b>Decoder:</b></dt>
 * <dd>An object that receives encoding packets, decodes them, and produces the original source data.</dd>
 * <dt><b>Decoding failure</b></dt>
 * <dd>The moment when the available encoding symbols in the decoder are not sufficient for a successful decoding of the
 * source block.</dd>
 * </dl>
 * <h3>Initializing</h3> Encoders and decoders are initialized with the help of <em>FEC parameters</em>. These include
 * the length of the data and information on how to partition the source data into source blocks and source symbols.
 * Encoders are initialized by passing source data and FEC parameters. Decoders are initialized by passing FEC
 * parameters.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> <em>The same FEC parameters must be passed to an encoder and a decoder in order to correctly decode the
 * original source data, which usually means transmitting the parameters to a receiver before sending data, so that the
 * receiver is able to initialize a decoder that matches the sender's encoder.</em>
 * <p>
 * Class {@link net.fec.openrq.openrq.OpenRQ OpenRQ} is the entry point for the OpenRQ API, and provides static methods for
 * initializing encoders and decoders.
 * <p>
 * FEC parameters are represented by {@link net.fec.openrq.openrq.parameters.FECParameters FECParameters} instances. They
 * provide methods for writing the parameters to a buffer or a writable channel, and static methods for parsing/reading
 * parameters from a buffer or a readable channel. Please refer to the documentation of class
 * {@link net.fec.openrq.openrq.parameters.FECParameters FECParameters} for more details.
 * <h3>Encoding data</h3> Source data encoders are represented by {@link net.fec.openrq.openrq.encoder.DataEncoder DataEncoder}
 * instances. They encapsulate source data and provide a separate encoder for each source block.
 * <p>
 * Source block encoders are represented by {@link net.fec.openrq.openrq.encoder.SourceBlockEncoder SourceBlockEncoder}
 * instances. They provide encoding packets that contain encoding symbols from the source block being encoded.
 * <p>
 * Encoding packets are represented by {@link net.fec.openrq.openrq.EncodingPacket EncodingPacket} instances. They provide
 * methods for writing the packet to a buffer or a writable channel, and static methods for parsing/reading a packet
 * from a buffer or a readable channel.
 * <p>
 * Please refer to the documentation of classes {@link net.fec.openrq.openrq.encoder.DataEncoder DataEncoder},
 * {@link net.fec.openrq.openrq.encoder.SourceBlockEncoder SourceBlockEncoder} and {@link net.fec.openrq.openrq.EncodingPacket
 * EncodingPacket} for more details.
 * <h3>Decoding data</h3> Source data decoders are represented by {@link net.fec.openrq.openrq.decoder.DataDecoder DataDecoder}
 * instances. They deliver source data, as it is being decoded, and provide a separate decoder for each source block.
 * They also help parsing/reading encoding packets from buffers or readable channels.
 * <p>
 * Source block decoders are represented by {@link net.fec.openrq.openrq.decoder.SourceBlockDecoder SourceBlockDecoder}
 * instances. They receive encoding packets and provide an indication of the current state of the source block.
 * <p>
 * Please refer to the documentation of classes {@link net.fec.openrq.openrq.decoder.DataDecoder DataDecoder} and
 * {@link net.fec.openrq.openrq.decoder.SourceBlockDecoder SourceBlockDecoder} for more details.
 * <h3>Dealing with decoding failures</h3> Here are some strategies for handling decoding failures:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Requesting missing source symbols</b>. This strategy works well if there is a back channel from receivers to
 * senders of data. Additionally, receivers may also indicate which repair symbols have been received, so that senders
 * may transmit new ones.
 * <li><b>Waiting for more encoding symbols</b>. This strategy works well if there is no back channel (or if it would be
 * expensive to have one) and the sender is continually transmitting encoding packets in a cyclic fashion.
 * <li><b>Working with available data</b>. Sometimes applications, such as video streaming ones, can simply tolerate
 * data losses (video frames for example). In these situations, the receiver may use the available data composed of the
 * decoded source symbols so far.
