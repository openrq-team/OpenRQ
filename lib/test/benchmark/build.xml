        The workflow is as follows:
          - Compile the benchmarks with JMH and JMH Annotation processor in classpath.
              * Annotation processors will run and generate synthetic code.
              * Annotation processors will create the list of discovered microbenchmarks.
          - Pack the classes, generated code, microbenchmark lists in a JAR
              * Bring the dependencies along in the JAR; Annotation processor is not
                required in final JAR
              * (You might be able to run JMH without the self-contained JAR,
                take note of the META-INF/* files in that case)
              * Filter out META-INF/services/ to disable JMH processors for the future
